  bio: "I work at the intersection of machine learning, remote sensing, and ecology to understand our functioning natural environment. The ability to capture high temporal, spatial, and spectral resolution imagery has advanced much more rapidly than algorithms for processing, visualizing, and interpreting these images. In my work, I aim to develop algorithms and methodologies for image processing that transform the data into manageable and applicable information for future applications. I use computational spatial methods to overcome these challenges,primarily with airborne hyperspectral, thermal, and LiDAR data."
